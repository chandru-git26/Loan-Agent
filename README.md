Building a Loan Autonomous Agent with Google ADK

I’m thrilled to share my latest project: a Loan Autonomous Agent built using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), designed to streamline loan processing through intelligent, context-aware interactions. This agent leverages ADK’s robust framework, powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash , to deliver a seamless user experience with advanced reasoning, memory retention, and dynamic information elicitation. Here’s a technical dive into how I brought this to life, emphasizing the ease of testing with ADK Web and the critical roles of Events, State, and Gemini models.

Simplifying Development and Testing with ADK Web

ADK Web provided an intuitive, out-of-the-box testing environment that accelerated the development cycle. By running adk web, I accessed a local dashboard (http://localhost:8000) to interact with the agent in real-time, inspect tool calls, and validate responses without complex setup. This streamlined testing process made iteration efficient, allowing me to focus on refining the agent’s behavior rather than wrestling with infrastructure.

Harnessing Events and State for Contextual Intelligence

The agent’s ability to maintain coherent, multi-turn conversations hinges on ADK’s Session and State management. Using the InMemorySessionService, I implemented a lightweight session layer that persists conversation history, tool outputs, and metadata as Events—immutable records of user messages, agent responses, and tool interactions. For example, when a user provides partial loan details, the agent logs these as Events and stores key parameters (e.g., loan amount, address ) in the session’s State, a mutable dictionary accessible via tool_context.state. This enables the agent to recall prior inputs, such as a user’s stated income, and adapt its responses dynamically. If critical data is missing, the agent proactively prompts for clarification, ensuring robust data collection for loan assessments.

Powering Interactivity with Gemini Models

The Gemini 2.5 Flash model, integrated via Google’s google-genai library, is the cognitive backbone of the agent. Its advanced reasoning and function-calling capabilities allow the agent to interpret natural language input, and generate structured JSON outputs conforming to defined schemas. The model’s large context window ensures it retains extensive session context, enabling nuanced responses tailored to user needs. For instance, when a user vaguely provides "4" for the address ,” the agent uses Gemini’s reasoning to ask targeted follow-ups, such as “Can you please provide the full address , City and Post code ” . If the user still provides partial information and missed providing the post code then gemini will prompt the user to provide the correct Post code to move ahead with the application .  This creates a highly interactive chat experience that feels human-like and responsive.

Why This Matters

By combining ADK’s modular architecture with Gemini’s intelligence, I built an agent that not only processes loan applications but also learns from each interaction, adapts to incomplete inputs, and maintains compliance with data validation protocols. The ease of testing via ADK Web, coupled with the power of Events, State, and Gemini models, made this project a testament to how modern AI frameworks can transform complex workflows into scalable, user-centric solutions.
